The control of the mechanical properties of single molecule in planar junction holds great promises for the future of nanotechology. To this end a better understanding of the mechanical response of single molecule on conducting surface when excited with a tunnelling current is necessary.

The [NanoCar race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocar_Race)  served as a benchmark for scientists around the world to test their design of single molecule machine powered by tunelling current. The [Swiss team](https://nanocar-race.cnrs.fr/equipes-ch.php) won the race on gold surface with their NanoDragster whose design and test was heavily backed by ab-initio calculations.
